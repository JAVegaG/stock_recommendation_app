# About This Project
This application is a full-stack system built with Golang for the backend and Vue 3 with TypeScript for the frontend. It retrieves stock recommendations from a third-party API, stores them in a CockroachDB database, and provides a clean, modern user interface where users can explore, filter, and analyze stocks.

The backend is structured following Clean Architecture principles, using repositories, use cases, and service layers to ensure separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability. The frontend is organized with an Atomic Design approach, promoting scalability and component reusability.
